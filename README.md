# Movies App Project - Marcela Britos & Indra Lima
## ADA ITW - FrontEnd

### Final Project - Module 6

We are Marcela Britos and Indra Lima, we are FrontEnd Development students at ADA ITW and this is our Module 6 Final Project.

## Project Description


This website shows information about movies using The Movie Database API (TMDB) and has been developed with knowledge of technologies like React JS with Vite, React Router DOM for navigation between views, and for styling we used a combination of frameworks like Swiper, Css Modules and Material-UI. 


This site allows you to navigate through Home, Last Movies, Popular Movies, Favorites and Search Movies to search and view information on each movie listing and also allows you to bookmark your favorites. 
I hope you enjoy it!

This project was made with the Github service, and you can see it through this [link]()
